# Maze-Generator-and-Search
A maze generator developed for CSI4130 - Artificial Intelligence class.



This program can randomly generate a maze with a start and exit spot. The maze generation is based on Prim's Algorithm.
The maze will then be searched using Breadth-First, Depth-First, Uniform-Cost, and Heuristic techniques.
Each search will output a graphic display of the path taken by the algorithms and other pertinent information.

Everyone is more than welcome to use this code! :)
