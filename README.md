# Maze-Generator-and-Search
A maze generator developed for CSI4130 - Artificial Intelligence class.



This program can randomly generate a maze with a start and exit spot. The maze generation is based on Prim's Algorithm.
Then, the maze will be searched using Breadth-First, Depth-First, Uniform-Cost, and Heuristic techniques.
Each search will output a graphic display of the path discovered through my algorithms, as well as cost, depth, time, and other notable attributes.

Everyone is more than welcome to use this code! :)
